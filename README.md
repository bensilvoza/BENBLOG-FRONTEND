#BENBLOG

Blog application for people who enjoy reading news, articles, culture, and events.
The site runs on Express Framework on the back-end. The project contains all the
features of a blog site like login, register, create posts, edit posts, delete posts, the
application follows CRUD operation best practice.

Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love.


with love,
